            As any successful hotel marketer knows, creating an engaging blog is critical to success.
            Yet writing blog posts is not as easy as simply typing willy-nilly then publishing your unedited thoughts.
            If you want to attract relevant web traffic and keep the SEO bots satisfied, you’ll need a better plan.
            
            While it’s a cliché, we have to agree that quality trumps quantity.
            At the same time, most hotel marketers don’t have the luxury of simply sitting around
            and waiting for the next ingenious idea to strike.
            
            If writing isn’t your strong suit, then creating and updating blog content can sometimes
            feel like an uphill battle. While we are all for breaking the content mould on occasion, 
            we can also see the value of certain tried-and-tested formats that can help you come 
            up with ideas for your hotel blog.
            
            Whether you’re looking for inspiration for your next post or for new formats to shake up
            your hotel blog, here are 10 types of posts that help increase web traffic.
